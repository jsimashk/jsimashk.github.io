                      In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface. 
                      Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, 
                      or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of
                      features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined below. 
                      Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or normal) to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, 
                      and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications. Two levels of abstraction are employed 
                      in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean
                      sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. 
                      The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude 
                      on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference 
                      surface. The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal 
                      to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute 
                      a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.
                      Since there are many different reference ellipsoids, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard 
                      which states that "without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and 
                      meaningless at worst". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy
                      is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.
